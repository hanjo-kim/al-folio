## Working Papers
- **Entrepreneurs, Financial Crisis, and Inequality in Emerging Markets** \\
*Abstract* I investigate how entrepreneurs shape distributional implications during a sudden stop. Using Argentina from 1998 to 2002 as a 
case study, this paper finds significant heterogeneity in household responses to a sudden stop across the income distribution as well as 
occupation groups. Motivated by this fact, I develop a heterogeneous agent model with an occupational choice between workers, self-employed 
entrepreneurs, and employer entrepreneurs in a small open economy real business cycle framework. The model correctly captures crucial aspects 
of the population distribution and predicts a rise in income inequality due to a crisis. Further steps to be undertaken in this research 
include proper calibration and policy analysis. 

- **Did Michigan Suffer a Greater Great Depression?" (with Dong Cheng and Mario Crucini)** \\
*Abstract*: We develop a three-sector, two-region model of durable goods and apply this model to study business cycle dynamics across regions of the U.S. during the Great Depression. The focus is on the ability of the durable goods channel coupled with specialization across regions to generate different cyclical amplitudes across durable good exporting and importing regions.

- **Is a Floating Exchange Rate Regime Desirable?** \\
*Abstract*: I develop a two sector heterogeneous agents New Keynesian (HANK) model in a small open economy setting with non-homothetic preferences to evaluate distributional implications of floating exchange rate regime. Exchange rate devaluations have distributional implications through two channels: consumption channel, where richer households gain relatively due to a larger consumption share on non-tradables compared to poorer households, and wealth revaluation channel, where poorer households suffer from the asset valuation readjustment. The model captures consumption and wealth heterogeneity at the household level as well as business cycle dynamics at the macro level. I then compare business cycle dynamics and welfare under two different exchange rate regimes and show distributional implications from implementing a floating exchange rate regime.
