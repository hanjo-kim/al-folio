## Working Papers
- **Entrepreneurs, Financial Crisis, and Inequality in Emerging Markets** \\
*Abstract*: What is the role of entrepreneurs in explaining income inequality during a financial crisis in emerging markets? I empirically
document the importance of entrepreneurs at the household level in explaining the rise in income inequality during a financial crisis in emerging
markets. I embed a model of heterogeneous agents with occupational choice between formal entrepreneurs, informal entrepreneurs, and workers into
an otherwise standard small open economy real business cycle model. The baseline model is able to capture heterogeneity at the household level as
well as business cycle dynamics at the aggregate level.

- **Did Michigan Suffer a Greater Great Depression?" (with Dong Cheng and Mario Crucini)** \\
*Abstract*: We develop a three-sector, two-region model of durable goods and apply this model to study business cycle dynamics across regions of the U.S. during the Great Depression. The focus is on the ability of the durable goods channel coupled with specialization across regions to generate different cyclical amplitudes across durable good exporting and importing regions.

- **Is a Floating Exchange Rate Regime Desirable?** \\
*Abstract*: I develop a two sector heterogeneous agents New Keynesian (HANK) model in a small open economy setting with non-homothetic preferences to evaluate distributional implications of floating exchange rate regime. Exchange rate devaluations have distributional implications through two channels: consumption channel, where richer households gain relatively due to a larger consumption share on non-tradables compared to poorer households, and wealth revaluation channel, where poorer households suffer from the asset valuation readjustment. The model captures consumption and wealth heterogeneity at the household level as well as business cycle dynamics at the macro level. I then compare business cycle dynamics and welfare under two different exchange rate regimes and show distributional implications from implementing a floating exchange rate regime.
