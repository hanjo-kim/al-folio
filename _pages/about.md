Welcome! My name is Hanjo Terry Kim (I go by my middle name, Terry). I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Economics at Vanderbilt University.

I focus on how the heterogeneity at the household level interact with aggregate dynamics in open economies. My job market paper explores the role of entrepreneurs in explaining rise in income inequality during sudden stop episodes. I also examine how the production specialization of different regions led to unequal outcomes during the Great Depression.

Here is a link to my [cv](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gy3kbyrrsohrioz/cv_hanjo_kim.pdf?dl=1).
